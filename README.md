## Election Audit Summary

Denver County had the highest voter turnout with 82.8% of the total votes.  This script can be used for future elections to help target voter registration initiatives to boost other counties. It can also be used by candidates to help target their campaigns.  

Additionally, modifications to this script to expand to larger elections can be done by including all counties in a state for state wide elections.  It can be modified to roll that up to votes per state for national elections.
